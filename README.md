An idea blatantly stolen from [Pragmatic
Thinking](http://www.amazon.com/Pragmatic-Thinking-Learning-Refactor-Programmers/dp/1934356050).
The following passage is taken from the book:

> This notion of combining two different, incompatible ideas is the very
> definition of creativity according to researcher/philosopher Arthur
> Koestler. In his model, some particular topic area forms a particular
> frame of reference. The sudden switch from one self-consistent frame of
> reference to a different, unexpected, incompatible frame of reference is
> the basis of a strong metaphor. That junction of the two different
> frames is called a *bisociation*.

> The more unlikely the association—the further apart the frames of
> reference—the greater the creative achievement when bisociated. This
> idea is the basis of Edward de Bono’s Po technique. Po is an invented
> word that tries to go beyond the binary notion of “yes” and “no.”
> Several techniques involve Po; for now, you might think of it as a
> super-powerful version of suppose.

> One of the Po techniques is **random juxtaposition**. You take a word
> from your subject area and combine it with a completely random,
> unrelated word. For instance, consider the words *cigarette* and
> *traffic light*. The challenge is to form a bisociation from these
> completely unrelated ideas. For example, cigarette and traffic light
> might meld into the concept of using a red band on the cigarette as a
> stop-smoking aid.

> The further away the ideas are, the harder it is to join them in a
> metaphor that works.
